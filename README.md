# DreamAlity

This application was born because I believe in dreams, but, most of all, I believe in our need of not forgetting to dream. 

Sometimes everyday life, especially in this society, keeps us so busy or worry that we forget how we really are. Or, sadly, makes us believe that we can never fulfill our dreams.
I am a dreamer, a have faith, I love believing. And I believe that, if I don't lose my faith, I will find a way to accomplish my dreams .
So, no matter what, do not forget to wish, to desire, to dream. 

And write down your dreams! I offer you an app for your phone or tablet, but it doesn't really matter where you write them as long as you do it. 
You can store them in your phone, but you can also write them on a paper and put them in a place so you see them very often. 
Just don't forget about them! 

This app wants to be of great help for those of you that find motivation in stories, quotes, questions that inspire you. 

Most of all, I believe in questions, questions that make me understand why I want something, because this gives power to my dreams. 
But there are also good movies or books that can get to me in the right moment so I feel inspired. 
It doesn't matter which way I choose, I need to have all these for all the moments I dream, but, mostly, for the one when I feel I'm lost. 
And I found something new: my <forget abouts> list: it is precious because this way I learn every day not to waste time and energy - they are limited. 

So I have built this app for my soul and I decided to share it to the world. If there is someone than will find it useful, I will be twice happy. 

Enjoy and remember to design the reality around you from your dreams! Don't let others create your life and don't go on just like that, based on inaction. Life is as beautiful as you make it! And you have to have faith!
